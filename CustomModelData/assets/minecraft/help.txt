Hey, this is a message from CJCrafter:

Sounds/Models are hard to get your hands on. If you don't
want to spend money on them, you have to create them. Note that
*IT IS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE SOUNDS*, but you can buy
sounds from, for example, the Unity Asset Store then convert them.

Convert your sounds: https://github.com/WeaponMechanics/MechanicsMain/wiki/Resource-Pack#converting-sounds


############################################


The sounds.json file is VERY VERY VERY picky on formatting. If something
goes wrong, NONE of your custom sounds will play. That is why it is CRUCIAL
that you use Visual Studio Code to edit .json files.

While we can help you create your own resource packs, most of this process
is on you. Unfortunately, that probably means learning through trial and error.
